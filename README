Currently, journals use peer review of context-data-evaluation-discussion monoliths to make a go/no-go choice regarding publication. We propose a non-binary model which harnesses the power of open collaboration, immediate publication, and transparent revision. We name this model, accordingly, Open Publication Revision (OPR). We believe that the worthiness of findings is never static, and can only be interpreted in light of their ability to support further developments. The delineated system is tailored to add value even to the least promising publications, rather than derive value for itself from the most promising ones. We believe our system would provide an immediate service to the scientific community by making otherwise lost findings viable.
