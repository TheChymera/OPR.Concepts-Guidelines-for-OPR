Scientific data is being produced at an ever increasing rate, challenging our means of communicating findings. Currently, journals act as filters, and use peer review of context-data-evaluation-and-discussion monoliths to make a go/no-go choice regarding publication. We propose a non-binary model which harnesses the power of open collaboration, immediate publication, and transparent revision. We name this model, accordingly, Open Publication Revision (OPR). We believe that the worthiness of findings is never static, and can only be interpreted in light of their ability to support further developments. Our model separates publication from revision and from quality assessment, and gives every finding the opportunity to make its way into highly regarded ensembles of knowledge.
