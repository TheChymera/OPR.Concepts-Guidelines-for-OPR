	perform a laboratory study of open and closed peer review based on
	an online game. We show that when reviewer behavior was made public
	under open review, reviewers were rewarded for refereeing and formed
	significantly more cooperative interactions (13\% increase in cooperation,
	P = 0.018). We also show that referees and authors who participated
	in cooperative interactions had an 11\% higher reviewing accuracy
	rate (P = 0.016). Our results suggest that increasing cooperation
	in the peer review process can lead to a decreased risk of reviewing
	errors.},

  abstract = {Should those who work on ethics welcome or resist moves to open access
	publishing? This paper analyses arguments in favour and against the
	increasing requirement for open access publishing and considers their
	implications for bioethics research. In the context of biomedical
	science, major funders are increasingly mandating open access as
	a condition of funding and such moves are also common in other disciplines.
	Whilst there has been some debate about the implications of open-access
	for the social sciences and humanities, there has been little if
	any discussion about the implications of open access for ethics.
	This is surprising given both the central role of public reason and
	critique in ethics and the fact that many of the arguments made for
	and against open access have been couched in moral terms. In what
	follows I argue that those who work in ethics have a strong interest
	in supporting moves towards more open publishing approaches which
	have the potential both to inform and promote richer and more diverse
	forms of public deliberation and to be enriched by them. The importance
	of public deliberation in practical and applied ethics suggests that
	ethicists have a particular interest in the promotion of diverse
	and experimental forms of publication and debate and in supporting
	new, more creative and more participatory approaches to publication.},

	Tools are provided within the package to allow everything from stimulus

	to simple data analysis such as psychometric function fitting. Most
	importantly, PsychoPy is highly extensible and the whole system can
	evolve via user contributions. If a user wants to add support for
	a particular stimulus, analysis or hardware device they can look
	at the code for existing examples, modify them and submit the modifications
	back into the package so that the whole community benefits.},

  abstract = {We aimed to determine the reproducibility of assessments made by independent
	reviewers of papers submitted for publication to clinical neuroscience
	journals and abstracts submitted for presentation at clinical neuroscience
	conferences. We studied two journals in which manuscripts were routinely
	assessed by two reviewers, and two conferences in which abstracts
	were routinely scored by multiple reviewers. Agreement between the
	reviewers as to whether manuscripts should be accepted, revised or
	rejected was not significantly greater than that expected by chance
	[kappa = 0.08, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to -0.20] for
	179 consecutive papers submitted to Journal A, and was poor (kappa
	= 0.28, 0.12 to 0. 40) for 116 papers submitted to Journal B. However,
	editors were very much more likely to publish papers when both reviewers
	recommended acceptance than when they disagreed or recommended rejection
	(Journal A, odds ratio = 73, 95\% CI = 27 to 200; Journal B, 51,
	17 to 155). There was little or no agreement between the reviewers
	as to the priority (low, medium, or high) for publication (Journal
	A, kappa = -0.12, 95\% CI -0.30 to -0.11; Journal B, kappa = 0.27,
	0.01 to 0.53). Abstracts submitted for presentation at the conferences
	were given a score of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent) by multiple independent
	reviewers. For each conference, analysis of variance of the scores
	given to abstracts revealed that differences between individual abstracts
	accounted for only 10-20\% of the total variance of the scores. Thus,
	although recommendations made by reviewers have considerable influence
	on the fate of both papers submitted to journals and abstracts submitted
	to conferences, agreement between reviewers in clinical neuroscience
	was little greater than would be expected by chance alone.},

	original research papers might be posted on the BMJ's website would
	affect the quality of their reviews.Randomised controlled trial.A
	large international general medical journal based in the United Kingdom.541
	authors, 471 peer reviewers, and 12 editors.Consecutive eligible
	papers were randomised either to have the reviewer's signed report
	made available on the BMJ's website alongside the published paper
	(intervention group) or to have the report made available only to
	the author-the BMJ's normal procedure (control group). The intervention
	was the act of revealing to reviewers-after they had agreed to review
	but before they undertook their review-that their signed report might
	appear on the website.The main outcome measure was the quality of
	the reviews, as independently rated on a scale of 1 to 5 using a
	validated instrument by two editors and the corresponding author.
	Authors and editors were blind to the intervention group. Authors
	rated review quality before the fate of their paper had been decided.
	Additional outcomes were the time taken to complete the review and
	the reviewer's recommendation regarding publication.558 manuscripts
	were randomised, and 471 manuscripts remained after exclusions. Of
	the 1039 reviewers approached to take part in the study, 568 (55\%)
	declined. Two editors' evaluations of the quality of the peer review
	were obtained for all 471 manuscripts, with the corresponding author's
	evaluation obtained for 453. There was no significant difference
	in review quality between the intervention and control groups (mean
	difference for editors 0.04, 95\% CI -0.09 to 0.17; for authors 0.06,
	95\% CI -0.09 to 0.20). Any possible difference in favour of the
	control group was well below the level regarded as editorially significant.
	Reviewers in the intervention group took significantly longer to
	review (mean difference 25 minutes, 95\% CI 3.0 to 47.0 minutes).Telling
	peer reviewers that their signed reviews might be available in the
	public domain on the BMJ's website had no important effect on review
	quality. Although the possibility of posting reviews online was associated
	with a high refusal rate among potential peer reviewers and an increase
	in the amount of time taken to write a review, we believe that the
	ethical arguments in favour of open peer review more than outweigh
	these disadvantages.},
